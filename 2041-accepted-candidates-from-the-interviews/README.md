<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- Candidate 11: The total score is 16, and they have one year of experience. We do not include them in the result table because of their years of experience.
- Candidate 9: The total score is 22, and they have six years of experience. We include them in the result table.
- Candidate 6: The total score is 10, and they have ten years of experience. We do not include them in the result table because the score is not good enough.
- Candidate 8: The total score is 6, and they have zero years of experience. We do not include them in the result table because of their years of experience and the score.
